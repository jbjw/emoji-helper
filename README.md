# emoji-helper
a web app for exploring and bookmarking/organizing emojis  

for some reason it takes me an unreasonable amount of effort to include emojis in my daily life. i often go to nice directories like https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/ or http://emojipedia.org/, but quickly get overwhelmed. this is a simple directory with the ability to organize your favorite emojis to enable painless emoji selection later on.
